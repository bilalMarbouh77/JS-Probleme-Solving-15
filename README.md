Question:

Write a JavaScript function that converts a given string 
into camel case. Camel case is a format where each word is 
joined without spaces, and the first letter of every word 
after the first is capitalized. The function should handle 
strings where words are separated by dashes (-) or underscores (_).

Examples:

toCamelCase("the-stealth-warrior")  
// Output: "theStealthWarrior"

toCamelCase("The_Stealth_Warrior")  
// Output: "TheStealthWarrior"

toCamelCase("hello_world")  
// Output: "helloWorld"
